## Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This project comprehensively introduces setting up and working with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It uses a modern web application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper project structure. The project covers fundermental concepts from initial setup to building interactive component and fetching data from APIs.

## Implementation guide
1. Start by setting up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
3. Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
4. Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
5. Implement the Header component for navigation
6. Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
7. Test each component and page as you build them.

# Expected outcomes
 - A fully functional Next.js application
 - Reusable components that follow TypeScript best practices
 - Proper routing between different pages 
 - API integration to fetch and display data 
 - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
 - Clean, well-organized codebase
